# SmartProxyDnsPowerdns

This plugin adds a new DNS provider for managing records in PowerDNS.

## Installation

See [How_to_Install_a_Smart-Proxy_Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Smart-Proxy_Plugin)
for how to install Smart Proxy plugins

This plugin is compatible with Smart Proxy 1.10 or higher.

When installing using "gem", make sure to install the bundle file:

	echo "gem 'smart_proxy_dns_powerdns'" > /usr/share/foreman-proxy/bundler.d/dns_powerdns.rb

## Configuration

To enable this DNS provider, edit `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/dns.yml` and set:

    :use_provider: dns_powerdns

Configuration options for this plugin are in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/dns_powerdns.yml` and include:

    :powerdns_mysql_hostname: 'localhost'
    :powerdns_mysql_username: 'powerdns'
    :powerdns_mysql_password: ''
    :powerdns_mysql_database: 'powerdns'

### DNSSEC

In case you've enabled DNSSEC (as you should), a rectify-zone is required after every zone change. The pdnssec command is configurable:

    :powerdns_pdnssec: 'pdnssec'

Or a more complex example:

    :powerdns_pdnssec: 'sudo pdnssec --config-name=myconfig'

### Running the integration tests

Since I'm mostly a python developer, I've written the integration tests in python.

First you need to run the smart proxy on `http://localhost:8000` and a powerdns instance on `127.0.0.1:5300` or change it in the fixtures.

It is assumed the powerdns instance has both the `example.com` and `in-addr.arpa` domains configured. If not, create them:

    INSERT INTO domains (name, type) VALUES ('example.com', 'master'), ('in-addr.arpa', 'master');
    INSERT INTO records (domain_id, name, type, content) SELECT id domain_id, name, 'SOA', 'ns1.example.com hostmaster.example.com. 0 3600 1800 1209600 3600' FROM domains WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM records WHERE records.domain_id=domains.id AND records.name=domains.name AND type='SOA');

Then you need to install the required dependencies (dnspython, pytest and requests). Then run the tests:

    py.test test/integration_tests.py
